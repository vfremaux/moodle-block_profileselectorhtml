moodle-block_profileselectorhtml
================================

This very simple block allows some content to be distributed against rules over the profile values.

Any amount of rules can be added, each projecting a specific content to the users in the block content.

Each rule can check 2 profile values and compute and operated result.

People matching several rules will see each matching content in order.

There is a specific content "for match none", and a last content can be shown to all (matching or non matching).

This allows providing specific information to be published to some class of users, independantly 
of their local role or status in the course.
