Profileseletorhtml block is a simple block that allows displaying contextual
content depending on some user fiedls having some specific values. It is part
of the enhanced HTML blocks set with profilespecificHtml, groupSpecificHtml
editableContentHtml and roleSpecificHtml. 

ProfilepspecificHtml block can switch content using up to 2 fields conditions. 
Fields can be usual standard fields of the user profile, or any custom profile field.

Distinct ocntent are attqched to a "rule", that is, a combination of expression
testing the value of a given field. 

Operators are : 

=
>
<
!=
~= (like)

You may combine both statements with a logical AND or a logical OR operator,
or ignore the second statement to build a "one field constraint" rule. 

Text will be output in block content if the rule triggers. 

Additional texts can be setup for : 

All users: This text will always appear in the block.

No matching rules: This text will only appear for user having none of the rules
triggering. 

Additionaly, some non editing course users could be allowed to change the content,
but not the rules. They also will be limitated to edit the content they can access,
depending on their profile values.
